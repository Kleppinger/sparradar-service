For the following loose shopping list, put the items in a structured format.
You have access to the searchProducts tool. Use it to search for products in the dataset and include an article number to the structured output.
You give the answer using the answer tool. Include the parsed products alongside the found productId's for the product (or null if not found).
Then add the total price to the answer's tool input, the field totalPrice must be calculated keeping in mind also the amount of the product, and 
look at the field grammage to determine a logical way to calculate the price.
For calculations you have access to the calculate tool. The total price should be returned in cents.

Rules:
- If no amount was specified, default to 1
- If a quantity is mentioned (e.g., "Six-Pack of beer"), extract the actual amount (6)
- Keep the original names and language (e.g., if German, keep German)
